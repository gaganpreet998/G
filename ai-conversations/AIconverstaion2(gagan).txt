2. Developing Natural Language Processing for Weather Questions

Question1: How can I parse natural language weather questions to extract location, time, and intent?
Source Chatgpt
Answer: Great question! To parse natural language weather questions and extract key details like location, timeframe, and intent, you can leverage the hands-on-ai package, which interfaces with a language model to do this kind of natural language understanding (NLU).

Approach
1. Prompt the AI model with a clear instruction to parse the user’s question.

2. Request the output in a structured format, such as JSON, with specific fields.

3. The AI will return the parsed elements like:
> location: e.g., "Melbourne"
> timeframe: e.g., "tomorrow", "this weekend", "today"
> intent: e.g., "rain", "temperature", "umbrella", "clothing advice"

Example prompt and code snippet

from hands_on_ai.chat import get_response
import json

def parse_weather_question(question):
    prompt = f"""
    Parse the following weather question into JSON with keys: location, timeframe, intent.
    Example input: "Will it rain tomorrow in Melbourne?"
    Example output: {{"location": "Melbourne", "timeframe": "tomorrow", "intent": "rain"}}
    
    Now parse this question: "{question}"
    Return only JSON.
    """
    
    response = get_response(prompt)
    
    # Convert the AI text response to a Python dictionary
    parsed = json.loads(response)
    return parsed

# Example usage
question = "Should I take an umbrella tomorrow in Sydney?"
parsed_question = parse_weather_question(question)
print(parsed_question)

Expected output:

{
  "location": "Sydney",
  "timeframe": "tomorrow",
  "intent": "umbrella"
}

Notes:
> If the location is missing, the AI might return "location": null or "". You can then prompt the user to specify it.

> You can extend intent to capture different user needs like rain, temperature, picnic suitability, etc.

> Want me to help you improve this for edge cases or handle ambiguous inputs?



Question2: Can you give me a sample prompt and expected output for the question "Will it rain tomorrow in Melbourne?"

Answer: Absolutely! Here's a sample prompt you could use with the AI (via the hands-on-ai package) and the expected output for the question:

Sample Prompt:
Parse the following weather question into JSON with keys: location, timeframe, intent.

Example input: "Will it rain tomorrow in Melbourne?"
Example output:
{
  "location": "Melbourne",
  "timeframe": "tomorrow",
  "intent": "rain"
}

Now parse this question: "Will it rain tomorrow in Melbourne?"
Return only JSON.
Expected AI Output

{
  "location": "Melbourne",
  "timeframe": "tomorrow",
  "intent": "rain"
}
This prompt tells the AI exactly what you want—structured info in JSON—and includes an example to help it understand the task.




Question3: How do I handle questions without explicit location?
Source Chatgpt
Answer: Great point! When a user’s weather question doesn't mention a location explicitly, here’s how you can handle it effectively:

Strategies to Handle Missing Location
Detect missing location in your parsed output:

If the AI returns "location": null, "", or no location key, treat it as missing.

Prompt the user to provide their location:

Ask a follow-up question like:
"I didn't catch the location. Could you please tell me which city you're asking about?"

Use a default location if available:

If your app has a previously entered or stored location (like the user’s default city), use that automatically.

Loop until location is obtained:

Keep prompting the user until a valid location is provided before answering their weather question.

Example flow in code:
parsed = parse_weather_question(user_question)

if not parsed.get("location"):
    location = input("Please enter the location you're interested in: ")
    parsed["location"] = location
Why is this important?
It avoids guessing or giving irrelevant info.

It creates a more natural, conversational experience.

Helps ensure your weather data fetch is accurate and useful.
