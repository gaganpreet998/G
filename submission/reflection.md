# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I used ChatGPT to help guide me through understanding the project requirements, writing and debugging Python code, structuring my notebook sections, and generating example prompts and responses for my AI assistant. The conversational help was particularly useful for breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and quickly resolving errors. I also experimented with the hands-on-ai toolkit to work with local language models and integrate AI functionality directly into my application.

## Prompting Techniques
I used several prompting strategies to improve response quality:
Structured Prompts: I gave the AI very clear instructions with examples and expected formats to ensure consistent results.
Role-based Prompts: I instructed the AI to behave like a weather assistant or coder when needed.
Refinement and Iteration: I refined my prompts based on the AI’s output, especially when the initial results weren't specific or accurate enough.

## What Worked Well?
One thing I’m proud of is successfully completing the entire notebook with all required sections working as intended. I integrated both weather data and natural language processing to build a complete user experience—from entering a location to asking weather questions and getting clear responses. I also ensured the menu interface was smooth and intuitive.


## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would improve the NLP parsing by training a small custom intent classifier instead of relying entirely on generic parsing. I’d also enhance the UI with a simple graphical interface instead of a text-based menu to make the experience more user-friendly.


## Final Thoughts
This project taught me how to combine AI tools, data retrieval, and Python programming into a functional application. I gained hands-on experience with prompt engineering, error handling, and system design. It was rewarding to see all the parts come together and build something that feels interactive and intelligent. Overall, it deepened my understanding of how AI can be integrated into real-world applications.
